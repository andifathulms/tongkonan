/**
 * What the app is called when it is not in a browser tab.
 *
 * It is a file under public/ rather than an app/manifest.ts, and generated
 * here rather than written by hand, for two reasons that pull in opposite
 * directions. Next's manifest file convention emits its <link> without the
 * base path — correct in dev, a 404 on Pages, where the site lives at a
 * subpath — so the manifest has to be a static asset the metadata points at.
 * But a static asset cannot read COPY, and a name and a tagline written down
 * twice are a name and a tagline that will disagree.
 *
 * Every URL in it is relative, so it resolves against wherever the manifest
 * itself is served from and the file is the same at any base path. That is
 * the one thing to preserve when editing: an absolute path here is a path
 * that is right on exactly one host.
 *
 * To regenerate after a copy change:
 *   WRITE_MANIFEST=1 pnpm vitest run test/manifest.test.ts
